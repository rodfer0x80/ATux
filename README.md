## Idea
-----------
We want to accept any arcade and retro game and controller and run it max
performance with modern graphical options.
We can make it a small top bot and also sell like different bases
that can be used to make the machine look like a normal sized 
arcade machine. This would make transport cheaper and probably
the whole process cheaper and we also offer an admin panel on our cloud
so we can gather data to sell if we need money to survive and we also
provide with better B2B experience, along with the price difference, 
I am thinking we can make tops for less than 200 and bottoms for less than 50.
Even if we 2x that and add 100 for transport tops and 50 to transport bottoms
it's still less than half the market price.
